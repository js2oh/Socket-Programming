Instructions to Run the Programs:
-To run server.py: ./server.sh <req_code>
-To run client.py: ./client.sh <server_address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>
-Make sure to run the server script first and then the client script!!!
-Parameters used:
	-<server_address>: the server address/name of the machine that the server is running on (e.g. ubuntu1604-002)
	-<n_port>: the negotiation port in integer for tcp connection
	-<req_code>: the request code in integer to verify the request
	-<msg>: the client's string message that will be reversed by the server

Undergrad Machines Tested on:
-server: ubuntu1604-002
-client: ubuntu1604-006

Regarding Compilation:
-Since I chose Python to write the program, no further compilation is needed nor makefile. Pyhton is cool.
